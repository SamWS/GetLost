##How to Use

[View App](https://getlostaus.herokuapp.com/events)

The page will load on your current location and surrounding areas. User the search bar or click on the map to find events happening near you. To create or join an event, sign up! There's 10 activities you can do, but we'll be bringing more to you in the future!

##Explanation of Technologies

This app is built on rails. We used:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Ruby
* Javascript
* GoogleMaps API
* Ajax
* Geocoder Gem - Ruby
* GoogePlaces API

We used the app Slack heavily, to send code and communicate in general. We also used We-Chat to send hilarious emojis and voice chat.

##Approach Taken

We decided to create a webpage where people would be able to find fun things to do with like-minded people.

First, we sat down and decided what we wanted our website to be able to do. After agreeing on what our website would feature we spent time drawing up the database for the project (which was revised a few times).
Then we drew up the wireframes several times until we were happy with how we wanted our websites to look.
After this we decided to section out the website so that each person had a clear direction to head in when starting the project.

Using Github, we often merged our files and kept tabs on what each member was doing.
Towards the end of the week we merged more frequently and then spent time fixing little bugs where we were able, as well as adding css to the project.

##Unsolved Problems / Features to add

- revisit the CSS and improve the overall look of the website
- dynamically generate the page layout using complex javascript templates
- add a weather API which tells you what the forecast is during your events listed dates
- fix the slideshow bug on home click
- give users the ability to upload a profile photo
- the ability to add hobbies
- categories your search parameters
- add comments to the events page
- suggest events features
- give users ability to send private messages
